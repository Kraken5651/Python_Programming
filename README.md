# Python Learning Journey 🐍  
Hey, I’m **Karan** — game dev learner, builder and ECE student.  
I’m currently diving into Python as one of my core skills.

## 🔍 What I watched  
I followed the tutorial “Complete Python Course for Beginners in Hindi”.  
It helped me learn:
- Setting up Python & IDE  
- Variables, data types, user input  
- Conditional logic & loops  
- Collections (lists, tuples, dicts, sets)  
- Functions & scope  
- Basic Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects)  
- File I/O, modules, exception handling  

## ✅ What I can do now  
- Write simple Python scripts to solve problems.  
- Use loops and conditionals to control flow.  
- Work with lists, dictionaries for data handling.  
- Create basic classes & use object-oriented structure.  
- Read from/write to files and handle errors gracefully.  

## 🎯 My next steps  
- Build a small Python project (e.g., CLI tool or script) to reinforce learning.  
- Integrate Python with one of my game dev or electronics projects.  
- Learn more advanced Python topics (decorators, generators, async).  
- Use Python as the base before building my AI assistant.

## 📚 Tools & Tech  
- Python 3.13  
- VS Code or PyCharm (IDE)  
- Basic understanding of OOP & scripting  
- My context: game dev (UE5), electronics (ECE) — integrating Python there  

## 🧩 Why this matters to me  
As an indie game dev builder, I want Python to become part of my toolkit — for tooling, scripting, AI experiments and automation.  
Learning Python strengthens my foundation so I can connect it with Unreal Engine workflows, Blender scripts or electronics-based builds.
